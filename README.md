# CS50-PSet-8-Mashup
This is my code for the "Mashup" assignment for Harvard's CS50 problem set 8.

Specifcation: implement a Flask website that allows the user to find links to local news stories by clicking at locations on a map, using the Google Maps API.

For more detailed specifications and the distribution code, please see: https://docs.cs50.net/2018/x/psets/8/mashup/mashup.html
